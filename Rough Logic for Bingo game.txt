Rough Logic for Bingo Game

What am I try to do?
A game where ability to make bingos out of 7 letters scrambled up

First I need a database of all the bingos in the dictionary
Then I am randomly(mayble sort the bingos according to difficulty?)  getting a bingo from the database, scrambling it up and presenting it to the user
The user then attempts to find the bingo out of the scrambled letters
Once they have guessed correctly it is unscrambled
	You could keep track of how many guesses they have, or not allow the user to submit until the bingo has been guessed correctly
Once they have guessed correctly, they receive a point and the program moves onto the next bingo

This game is trying to improve the users ability to play Scrabble?
